# Summary
- This script can be used for any election ranging from class president to president of the united states. It can be used as a tool to give us direction on where to target campaigns to further impact our results. For example, since Denver is the largest country you should try to win votes from there because it would greatly impact your winning percentage. One thing I would like to change about this script or even how they collect data would be learning people's race or financial situations. From past research and history, there's a correlation between race and financial situation to policies that are being established by each candidate.
